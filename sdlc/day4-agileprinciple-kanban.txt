what is Agile..?
----------------- 
    -> It is a iterative incremental software developement model,
    where the product the features is developed in sprints, at the 
    end of the spirnt the customer can review the feature and give 
    the feedback for any improvement.

Agile planning techniques:-
------------------------------
   focus on,
      ->product backlog,
      ->story point estimation        

   steps:-
   -------
    1.schedule regular backlog grooming session.  
          ( regular update the backlog sheet every 2 weeks).

    2.assemble the right team:-
                    invite stackholder,product owner, manager, developer,
               tester,  every should be aware of individual contribution.
   
    3. review the current backlog:- 
              review the current backlog, identify the completed items,
           itentify the work in progress,  and new items needs to start.
    
    4.prioritize backlog items:-
            prioritize the remaining the items form the backlog, on the 
            business needs and market the item needs to prioritize.
              eg:-
              ---- 
                 which work needs to complete first.

    5.break down large task:- 
                in the product backlog if any item is large, then break 
                down into small managable task.
    
    6.define the acceptance criteria:- 
           ->ensure each item in the backlog has clear acceptance criteria.
           -> this helps to prevent misunderstanding, and ensure every one 
           aware what needs to done, based on customer requirement.
                 
    7.estimation of task:-
             -->specify the time required to complete the task.
            --> this helps to the sprint duration.

    8. identify the project dependency:-
             identify any 3 party api integration is needed.
                eg:-
               -> like payment gateway.
               -> google map integration.
====================================================================
spring planning:-
------------------
   [before the sprint start , there is a spring planning meeting will be there]
    
    in spring planning meeting, 
        product onwer,scrum master, manager, developer, tester, all are involved
        in sprint planning meeting.

  1. set the goal.
  2. review the backlog items 
  3. select the user stories.
  4. breakdown the user stories.
  5. estimate the task.
  6. create the sprint backlog.
  7. commit the work. (what needs to complete in the sprint)

example of spring planning..?
-----------------------------
step1:- the scrum master start the planning metting, and outline the goal
        to deliver login feature of the application.

step2: the product owner describe the user stories, related to the login 
       feature.   
              such as how the login should work, 
                    user authentication,
                    password reset, 
                    social media login (facebook,gmail)

step3:- the team agress on the goal, to develope login feature, 
      with in 3 weeks.

step4: the team to collobrates to select the user stories, from the product 
      backlog.   

step5:the team divides the work into, 
               frontend developement
               backend developement,
                testing,

step6:the task are estimated, 
             frontend -> 10 hour 
             backend -> 25 hour 
             testing -> 8 hour.

step7: the team creates the sprint backlog, with all the task need to complete 
       for login feature.

step8: done creteria for coading, testing. 
            (what types testing)
            (what scocial media,should work)

step9:finalize the sprint goals, what needs to devliver for login feature  

======================================================================
Roles:-
--------- 
1.Product Onwer
2.Scrum master 
3.the team (cross functional team) developer,tester,..

          core responsiblity: develope the valuable product.             

=========================================================================
How to conduct a effective daily stand up meeting..?
---------------------------------------------------
1.set the time and place. 
            ->schedule a fixed time and location for the standup meeting,
            ->preferably at the start of the day,ensure that every one can attend.
                eg:-
                ---  
                   9:00 am every day 

2.start on time:  start the metting on time, keep in mind what 
                  is the purpose of the meeting.

3.stand up: encuorage the team member during the meeting, to keep status

          eg:-
          -----
           sachin : yestarday i completed the 5 test case login feature, 
                    today i will work rest password test   
                    no blocking.                             
            
           rahul: yestarday worked on payment module,  
                  today i will on upi paymnet. 
                  issue in payment, not showing in transaction history. 

5. the dissussion should be on the current task.and identify if any 
   team memeber is facing the issue.

6.The team should come forward to resolve the issue. 
      eg:-
      ---- 
         since rahul has issue, sachin came forward and tells he will

7.follow the start and end time meeting: 
     don't extends the meeting. 
        9.00 am - 9.20 am
          end the meeting at 9.20 am, 

Note:-
--------- 
   the stand up meeting happens daily. 

=======================================================================   
Importance of Sprint Review:-
------------------------------
   ->Sprint reviews play a vital role in agile development, because it 
   provides opportunity for the team to showcase the work what has been 
   completed to the stackholder, and get the feedback.
      
      key points:-
      ------------ 
        1. showcase the completed work.
        2. collect the feedback 
        3. validate the requirement. -> sprint reviews helps to validate the 
                                      product, weather the product developed 
                                      as per the customer reuqirement.
        
        4.Transpranceny and colloboration. 
                              the team openly collobrates with the stackholder.

        5.Improve the product quality. 
                 feedback collected during the spring review, helps to identify 
                 the issue at the early stage of developement, which leads 
                 improve the quality of the software.

Kanban Framework:-
------------------
   ->It is one of the agile framework.
   ->It provides the work completed in visualization format.

history:-
---------- 
     toyata--> 
        car manufacturing 

        to manufacture a car, It needs the items in the warehouse, 

    warehouse:-
    ------------ 
         It has the material stock, -->some times the warehouse contains 
         the stock which might not be useful in car manufacture, this leads 
         to waste material.    

 
 -> kanban borad spilts the task in visualization column.  
       
        todo                      in progress              completed
      ----------------           -------------------        ---------------
       ->get the requirement     finalize the requirement   requirement completed
       -> order the raw material   yet to receive       
       -> manufacture the car

Kanban Rules:-
---------------
   1.visualization of the work. 
   2.Linit the work in progress.
   3.maintain the flow 

=================================================================

difference between kanban  and scrum:-
---------------------------------------------
   Kanban               vs                     Scrum 
   ---------------                 ---------------------- 
  work is visualised on           work is organised in fixed sprint
  kanban board     

  no fixed time frame            planning occurs at the start of the 
  for planning                   sprint, with scope and duration.

  No fixed backlog, work          It has a product backlog, with 
  items are pulled from todo      items are prioritize.
  list.

  In Kanaban the meetings          It has regular meets,sprint planning
  are rare, only if required       daily stand up, spring review,..
  then they will conduct.

  No specific roles,                roles, product onwer, scrum master,
                                    devlopment team.


=======================================================================
How to choose between scrum and kanban...?


Scrum:-
-------- 
   1. stable team 
   2. fixed-length iteration.
   3. specific roles and ceremonies are valued.

kanban:-
---------
   1.work is continuous.
   2. flexibility in roles and process is cruical. 
   3. no fixed iterations.

================================================================
  draw a kanban board for your case study.

===============================================================
Lean:-
-------  
   -> It provides a guidline to reduce waste.
   -> It is is implemented in different industries, 
           -> manufacturing industries
           -> project mgmt industries. 

    lean principle:-
    ---------------- 
       1. defining the value. 
                the first principle involves identifying what customer 
             values the most. 
                understand the customer needs and helps the orginization 
             to provide the required services what customer needs acutally.           

        2.Eliminate the waste:- 
                  -> waste reduction,
                  -> unnecessary features should be removed        
        
        3.continious improvement:- 
              -> quality should be improved. 
              -> outcomes should be improved.
        
        4. team colloboration:- 
                -> difference team member collobrates, 
                -> team member can take decesion, identify any issues,.
